## Requirements

* cUrl extension installed; In order to call and obtain the information from Sales Layer.
* Define the fields relationship in the Sales Layer Magento connector:
  * Most Magento fields are already defined in each section, extra fields for products or variants will be Stores -> Attributes -> Product and they must have been created in Magento in order to synchronize.
  * When synchronizing a product with variants, Magento attributes that are synchronized will be marked as Used for variations, then, attribute values from the product and variants will be combined and assigned to the parnet product. Variations must have only one value for each attribute.
* Inside categories, products and variants there will be attributes; Sales Layer Product Identification, Sales Layer Product Company Identification and Sales Layer Format Identification, don't modify or delete this attributes or its values, otherwise, the products will be created again as new ones in the next synchronization.
* Inside the connector configuration you can set different values before the synchronization in the different tabs, such as:
  * Auto-synchronization and preferred hour for it.
  * The stores where the information will be updated.
  * The root category where the incoming category branch will be set.
  * Avoid stock update (stock will be updated only at creation of new items)
  * Variant configurable attributes
